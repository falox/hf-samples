# Running Open Source AI Models from Hugging Face

This notebook shows you how to use one of the thousands of open source AI models hosted on [Hugging Face](https://hf.co). Use these examples to quickly test the behavior of the different models and validate your ideas.

The easiest way to run the notebook is via Google Colab, but you can run it in any Jupyter Notebook environment or copy/paste the code into a Python 3.8+ terminal.

- Go to https://colab.research.google.com/drive/
- Select _File / Upload notebook_ and choose `hugging_face_samples.ipynb`
- Add a secret `HF_TOKEN` with your [Hugging Face token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
- Select _Runtime / Change runtime type / T4 GPU_ (required when running a model locally)
